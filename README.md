 Designed and trained a CNN from scratch in Python to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset, achieving an accuracy of approximately 80%. Experimented with different numbers of layers and filters to find the optimal model, and compared the results of the custom CNN model with Transfer Learning (VggNet).
